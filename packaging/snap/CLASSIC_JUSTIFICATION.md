# Classic confinement justification — thirdflare-one

**Snap name:** `thirdflare-one`  
**Confinement:** classic

## Why classic is required

ThirdFlare One is a **control plane** for the host Cloudflare WARP client. It must:

1. Execute **`warp-cli`** on the host filesystem (not inside the snap sandbox)
2. Communicate with the **CloudflareWARP** system daemon
3. Read/write runtime state under user XDG paths (`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, cache) consistent with the official WARP workflow

Strict confinement prevents reliable access to the host `warp-cli` binary and WARP UNIX sockets. The application does not implement its own VPN tunnel — it orchestrates the existing official WARP install.

## Security model

- Binds HTTP API to `127.0.0.1` by default
- Does not bundle or replace Cloudflare WARP
- Invokes `warp-cli` via argument allow-lists (no shell)

## User documentation

Install Cloudflare WARP before using ThirdFlare One:
